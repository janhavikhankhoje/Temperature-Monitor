I worked on a temperature sensor/monitor to acheive a precision greater than 0.1°C across the calibrated temperature range. This sensor accounts for changes in ambient temperature while measuring a body temperature range of 35°C - 45°C. Two thermistors are used to measure surrounding temperature and one is placed horizontally to interface with the wrist.
